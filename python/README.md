Directory contains the Python codes implemeting the following exercises:
1. Exercise 1 : Contains a CLI tool build in Python which accepts the absolute path for a python file and imports the module relatively.  
   a) Instructions to run (In command terminal):  
      `./exercise1.py --path [Absolute Path of dummy.py]`
3. Exercise 2: Contains a CLI tool to implement the intersection of two lists which may be provided as argument while calling the CLI or as random values.  
   a) Instruction to run:   
      (i) For input values:     
      `./exercise2.py --val '["42, 30, 12, 22, 71, 60, 57, 54, 73, 23, 19, 35", "67, 70, 39, 70, 66, 59, 84, 46, 71, 43, 4, 22, 61"]' '["5, 78, 23, 4, 9, 0, 36, 1", "77, 33, 26, 0, 5, 19, 44"]'`  
      (ii) For Random values:  
      ` ./excercise1 --random `
